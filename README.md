## 🧩 Introduction

This project focuses on building a custom media player user interface with interactive buttons such as **Play**, **Next**, **Previous**, **Shuffle**, and **Repeat**, following a reference design.

Key objectives of the project:

- Develop all UI components using QML (no drag-and-drop)
- Handle mouse interactions: hover, press, and release
- Implement visual state switching using images
- Organize project structure cleanly for scalability

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: QML (Qt Quick)  
- **Framework**: Qt 5/6  
- **Tools**: Qt Creator IDE  
- **Concepts**:
  - Event handling (`hover`, `pressed`, `released`, `exited`)
  - State-based image changes
  - Layout management with `ColumnLayout`, `RowLayout`, `Rectangle`, `MouseArea`
  - Component reuse via custom QML files

## 🖼️ Features

- 🔁 Toggle `Shuffle` and `Repeat` buttons with visual feedback
- 🎵 Animate Play, Next, and Previous buttons on click
- ✨ Smooth transitions on hover and hold states
- 📁 Modular codebase for reusability and clarity
- ✅ Cleanly structured `.pro`, `images/`, and `qml/` folders
